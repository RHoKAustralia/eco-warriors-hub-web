      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p>EcoWarriorsHub is the place where young people go to find support, so that they feel empowered to get their ideas into action and collaborate with organisations to create positive impact on the planet.
The rising awareness around the dire state of the planet has reached young people. While school kids through to university students have great ideas and want to be part of the solution, they often feel powerless and that their actions lack impact. Organisations on the other hand, do excellent work in the environmental sustainability space but struggle to connect to volunteers.
EcoWarriorsHub will bring these two groups together by providing a ‘one-stop shop’ online platform where EcoWarriors can find information about a suite of sustainability projects run by various organisations, network and connect around projects that they are passionate about. Councils, industry partners and other external stakeholders provide funding and mentorship.</p>

      <p>Mission statement: Our mission is to enable young people to create a positive impact on the planet through environmental and sustainable projects.</p>

      <p>Vision statement: Fostering youth passion about environmental sustainability and enabling action.</p>
